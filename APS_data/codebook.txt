The test consisted of 30 items, RA1-8, LP1-8, MF1-8, and V1-6.

For each item, 4 values were recorded. e.g. RA1A, RA1O, RA1I, RA1E

A - The response on a 5 point scale to the item. A 1 = strong preference for option A (see images/), a 5 = strong preference for option B (see images/).
O - The orientation of the item. Which item was displayed on the left and right was randomly assigned. 1=A was displayed on left, 2=B was displayed on left. (this is not needed to interpert the scale response, ignore this value for most purposes)
I - the position of the item in the test for the user (order of items presented is random for each user)
E - the time elapsed on that item in milliseconds

After the test there was an optional survey with these questions:

The Ten Item Personality Inventory was administered (see Gosling, S. D., Rentfrow, P. J., & Swann, W. B., Jr. (2003). A Very Brief Measure of the Big Five Personality Domains. Journal of Research in Personality, 37, 504-528.):

TIPI1	Extraverted, enthusiastic.
TIPI2	Critical, quarrelsome.
TIPI3	Dependable, self-disciplined.
TIPI4	Anxious, easily upset.
TIPI5	Open to new experiences, complex.
TIPI6	Reserved, quiet.
TIPI7	Sympathetic, warm.
TIPI8	Disorganized, careless.
TIPI9	Calm, emotionally stable.
TIPI10	Conventional, uncreative.

The TIPI items were rated "I see myself as:" _____ such that

1 = Disagree strongly
2 = Disagree moderately
3 = Disagree a little
4 = Neither agree nor disagree
5 = Agree a little
6 = Agree moderately
7 = Agree strongly



The following items were presented as a check-list and subjects were instructed "In the grid below, check all the words whose definitions you are sure you know":

VCL1	boat
VCL2	incoherent
VCL3	pallid
VCL4	robot
VCL5	audible
VCL6	cuivocal
VCL7	paucity
VCL8	epistemology
VCL9	florted
VCL10	decide
VCL11	pastiche
VCL12	verdid
VCL13	abysmal
VCL14	lucid
VCL15	betray
VCL16	funny

A value of 1 is checked, 0 means unchecked. The words at VCL6, VCL9, and VCL12 are not real words and can be used as a validity check.
