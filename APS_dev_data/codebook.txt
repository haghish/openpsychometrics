This data comes from a beta version of the Artistic Preferences Scale. This dataset is a bit complicated to analyze and understand, the dataset from the final version is recommended for most uses. 

The test was offered on-line, and people took it with the motivation of receiving personalized results.

The test always consisted of 75 items, Q1-Q75.

For each item, two values were recorded. e.g. Q1A, Q1E

A - The response on a 5 point scale to the item. A 1 = strong preference for option A, and 5 = strong preference for option B 
E - the time elapsed on that item in milliseconds

This test came in multiple different versions, and they are all combined here. THEY MUST BE SEPARATED FOR ANALYSIS TO MAKE SENSE. Q1 of form-1 is not the same thing as Q1 of form-200.

The id of the form is stored in the value "formid". To get the items used in each form, consult forms.txt.

These values were also collected:
