1. they use is for scholarly research purposes with no commercial intention
2. their use is transformative, and for an entirely different function than the works were originally created for
3. their use does not affect the market for the works
4. only parital low resolution versions of the works are used

If you go on to distribute or use this images for other purposes, you may not be covered under fair use!
