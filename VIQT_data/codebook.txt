This data was collected on-line through an interactive test titled "Vocabulary IQ Test" between July 2017 and March 2018. 

The main body of the test had 45 vocabulary questions. Each question was a list of five words. Subjects were instructed to select the two on the list that had the same meaning. Subjects were also instructed to not guess and were told there was a -0.35 point penalty for a wrong answer.

Calculated scores are availible in these three variables:
score_right	Number of questions that were answered correctly.
score_wrong	Number of questions that were answered incorrectly.
score_full	= score_right - 0.35 * score_wrong


Below are the words used for the questions with the correct answers for each question:

The given answer is an integer converted from a binary representation of words selected, where 1=selected, 0=unselected

3 = 11000
5 = 10100
6 = 01100
9 = 10010
10 = 01010
12 = 00110
17 = 10001
18 = 01001
20 = 00101
24 = 00011

So, if an answer is recorded as 3 -> that means the first two words of the list of five words were selected. In this dataset, an answer may also be -1 (subjected select 'don't know') or 0 (subject did not respond to question at all)
