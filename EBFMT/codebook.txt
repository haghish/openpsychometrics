The main test had 75 questions. For each two values were recorded: the subjects answer (1=new, 2=seen) and how long they took to answer that question (in milliseconds).

These values are in

Q1, Q2, .... Q75
LAPSE1, LAPSE2, .... LAPSE75

Then users were given the option to take a survey to help with research. The survey has the following questions

engnat	"Is English your native language?" 1=yes, 2=no
age	Entered as text
education	"How much education have you completed?"  1=Less than high school, 2=High school, 3=University degree, 4=Graduate degree\
gender	1=Male, 2=Female, 3=Other
urban	"What type of area did you live when you were a child?"	1=>Rural (country side), 2=Suburban, 3=Urban (town, city)
orientation	"What is your sexual orientation?"	1=Heterosexual, 2=Bisexual, 3=Homosexual, 4=Asexual, 5=Other
race	1=Mixed race, 2=Asian, 3=Black, 4=Native American, 5=Native Australian, 6=White, 7=Other
religion	1=Atheist/Agnostic, 2=Christian, 3=Muslim, 4=Jewish, 5=Hindu, 6=Buddhist, 7=Other
hand	"What hand do you use to write with?"	1=Right, 2=Left, 3=Both



This survey also had a short personality segment, where user rated 11 personality test items on a 5 point scale. The items were randomly selected from the 100 items of the HEXACO-PI-R.

The responses to these items are stored in the values 

PQ1, PQ2, ..... PQ100

The value is -1 if that item was not included at that time. The scale items were labeled 1=Disagree, 3=Neutral, 5=Agree (so 0 if no response).

The order of the items as they were sampled is also included in the values

PQI1, PQI2, .... PQI11

So, for example if PQI1 was 66, that means item 66 from the HEXACO-PI-R was the first item in the personality test grid (this would mean that PQ66 would have some value other than -1).
