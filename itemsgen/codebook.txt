This data comes from a survey that was appended to multiple on line personality tests.

After a test participants were asked if they would be willing to take a 2-4 minute survey before they viewed their results (approximately 50% said yes).

Participants who took this survey were asked to generate three personality test items that showcased what was unique about their personality.

These responses are in

item1
item2
item2

Then users were asked a few more questions

age	entered as text (ages < 13 not recorded)
gender	chosen from drop down (1=male, 2=female, 3=other)
engnat	"Is English your native language?" (1=yes, 2=no)

One value was infered from technical information

country	ISO country code

At the end users were asked if their answers were accurate and asked to confirm their consent for their data to be used. Users who said no were not recorded.

For this dataset, records where the items were not completed are not included.
