After a user had completed the FTI, they were asked if they would be willing to answer a short research survey before they viewed their results.

This dataset only contains those people who took the optional survey.

The Ten Item Personality Inventory was administered (see Gosling, S. D., Rentfrow, P. J., & Swann, W. B., Jr. (2003). A Very Brief Measure of the Big Five Personality Domains. Journal of Research in Personality, 37, 504-528.):

TIPI1	Extraverted, enthusiastic.
TIPI2	Critical, quarrelsome.
TIPI3	Dependable, self-disciplined.
TIPI4	Anxious, easily upset.
TIPI5	Open to new experiences, complex.
TIPI6	Reserved, quiet.
TIPI7	Sympathetic, warm.
TIPI8	Disorganized, careless.
TIPI9	Calm, emotionally stable.
TIPI10	Conventional, uncreative.

The TIPI items were rated "I see myself as:" _____ such that

1 = Disagree strongly
2 = Disagree moderately
3 = Disagree a little
4 = Neither agree nor disagree
5 = Agree a little
6 = Agree moderately
7 = Agree strongly



The following items were presented as a check-list and subjects were instructed "In the grid below, check all the words whose definitions you are sure you know":

A value of 1 is checked, 0 means unchecked. The words at VCL6, VCL9, and VCL12 are not real words and can be used as a validity check.
